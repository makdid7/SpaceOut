# Space Out
A UI-focused star-gallery app reflecting my fascination with the pulchritude of outer space. My first experimentation with Android's Jetpack Compose, a modern multiplatform UI framework by Google.

## Areas of focus
* Architectural modularity
* Visuotextual harmony
* Responsive layout
* Positive & negative space
